Columbus {{VERSION}}, a test release. Click a link to download that file.

**New in this version: Settings changes apply at once, and a Test button.** Changes you make in Settings (connections, edits, scripts) reach Claude on its next request: no more quitting Claude desktop after each change. Tightening takes effect immediately; anything that gives your assistant more access still asks for Touch ID or your password (Windows Hello on Windows) first. In the connection editor, **Test** has the running Columbus open the connection exactly as it would use it, before you save, and says how many datasets it can see. Update both the extension and the app. Since 0.5.0: Settings in the Columbus app; since 0.4.0: editing data in GeoPackage and PostGIS.

## Mac (Apple Silicon: M1 or later)

**Already set up Columbus before? Update with these two files:**

1. **Claude extension:** [columbus-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.mcpb]({{BASE}}/columbus-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.mcpb). Double-click it in your Downloads folder. Claude desktop asks to install or update the extension: accept, check that **Engine Python** still says `/Users/<you>/Columbus/engine/venv/bin/python3`, then quit Claude with **Cmd+Q** and open it again.
2. **Columbus app (optional):** [columbus-app-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.dmg]({{BASE}}/columbus-app-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.dmg). Double-click it and drag **Columbus** onto **Applications**. Then, once, in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Columbus.app`

**New to Columbus?** Also download the server folder, [columbus-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.zip]({{BASE}}/columbus-{{VERSION}}-macos-arm64.zip), and follow the [Mac install guide](https://github.com/wiatrek-kevin-s/columbus/blob/main/docs/install-macos.md) from step 1. You only need the folder once, to set up the GIS engine.

## Windows (10 and 11, 64-bit)

**Already set up Columbus before? Update with these two files:**

1. **Claude extension:** [columbus-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64.mcpb]({{BASE}}/columbus-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64.mcpb). Double-click it, accept the update in Claude desktop, check **Engine Python**, then quit Claude completely (not just its window) and open it again.
2. **Columbus app (optional):** [columbus-app-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64-setup.exe]({{BASE}}/columbus-app-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64-setup.exe). Run it; it installs for you alone, no administrator needed. Windows SmartScreen warns because it is not signed yet: **More info**, then **Run anyway**. For IT: [the .msi]({{BASE}}/columbus-app-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64.msi).

**New to Columbus?** Also download the server folder, [columbus-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64.zip]({{BASE}}/columbus-{{VERSION}}-windows-x64.zip), and follow the [Windows install guide](https://github.com/wiatrek-kevin-s/columbus/blob/main/docs/install.md) from step 1.

## What the files are

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `.mcpb` | The Columbus server as a Claude desktop extension: Claude starts it for you |
| `columbus-app-…` | The Columbus app: each running session's layers on a map, its tables, checks, and the requests waiting for your decision; and a chat with Claude using your own Anthropic API key |
| `.zip` | The server as a folder, with the GIS engine setup script, examples, skills and guides |

Nothing is code-signed yet, which is why macOS and Windows warn; the steps above say what to do.
